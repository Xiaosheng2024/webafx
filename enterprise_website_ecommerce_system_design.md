# Enterprise Website & E-Commerce Platform System Design

## Implementation approach

Based on the requirements in the PRD, we need to build a professional corporate website/e-commerce platform for showcasing scanning equipment, printing equipment, software servers, and integrated packaging solutions. The main challenges and their solutions are:

### Difficult Points Analysis

1. **Product Information Management**: The system needs to handle different product types with varying attributes and specifications. We'll use a flexible product data model with customizable attribute schemas.

2. **Content Association Mechanism**: The requirement to link products, articles, and cases requires a sophisticated tagging and relationship system.

3. **Multi-media Content Display**: Supporting various media formats (images, videos, 3D models) requires integration with specialized libraries.

4. **Search & Filter Functionality**: Users need to quickly find products based on different criteria and perform comparisons.

5. **Responsive Design & Performance**: The system must perform well across devices and handle potential traffic surges.

### Selected Technology Stack

Based on the PRD's suggested technology stack and considering the project requirements:

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR)
- **UI Library**: Ant Design for enterprise-grade UI components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: Redux with Redux Toolkit for global state management
- **Media Components**: Video.js for video, react-image-gallery for image galleries, and Three.js for potential 3D displays

#### Backend
- **Language & Framework**: Node.js with Next.js API routes for frontend-connected APIs and Express.js for dedicated backend services
- **CMS**: Strapi (headless CMS) for content management with custom extensions
- **Database**: MySQL for structured product data and content
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for full-text search and product filtering

#### Infrastructure
- **Web Server**: Nginx for static content serving and load balancing
- **Cloud Provider**: Alibaba Cloud or Tencent Cloud
- **CDN**: Alibaba Cloud CDN/Tencent Cloud CDN for global content delivery
- **Object Storage**: Alibaba OSS/Tencent COS for storing media files
- **Security**: HTTPS throughout with Let's Encrypt certificates

### Open Source Libraries Selection

1. **Frontend Libraries**:
   - next-i18next: For future multi-language support
   - react-query: For efficient API data fetching and caching
   - react-hook-form: Form handling and validation
   - swiper: For carousels and sliders
   - react-responsive: For responsive design features
   - axios: HTTP client for API requests

2. **Backend Libraries**:
   - jsonwebtoken: For secure authentication
   - multer: For file uploads handling
   - sharp: For image optimization
   - node-cache: For application-level caching
   - winston: For logging
   - joi: For API validation
   - helmet: For security headers

3. **DevOps Tools**:
   - Docker & Docker Compose: For containerization
   - PM2: For Node.js application process management
   - Jenkins or GitHub Actions: For CI/CD
   - Prometheus & Grafana: For monitoring

## Data structures and interfaces

The system will be structured into several key modules working together. The data structure design focuses on flexibility, extensibility, and efficient retrieval.

### Core Data Structures and APIs

A comprehensive class diagram is provided separately in the `enterprise_website_ecommerce_class_diagram.mermaid` file. Here is a summary of the main components:

1. **Product System**: Manages all product-related data with support for different product types
2. **Content System**: Handles articles, cases, and other content types with flexible categorization
3. **User System**: Manages authentication, roles, and user profiles
4. **Inquiry System**: Processes customer inquiries and consultations
5. **System Management**: Provides admin tools and system configuration

### Key Design Considerations

1. **Flexible Product Attribute System**: Products have both common and type-specific attributes
2. **Content-Product Relations**: Bidirectional relationships between content and products
3. **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for frequently accessed data
4. **API Design**: RESTful APIs with standardized response formats
5. **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control with JWT tokens

## Program call flow

The sequence diagrams illustrating the key processes are detailed in the `enterprise_website_ecommerce_sequence_diagram.mermaid` file. The main flows include:

1. **Product Browsing & Filtering Flow**: How users navigate and filter products
2. **Content Association Flow**: How related content is displayed alongside products
3. **Inquiry Submission Flow**: How customer inquiries are processed
4. **Admin Content Management Flow**: How administrators manage products and content
5. **Search Functionality Flow**: How search queries are processed

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Product Data Integration**
   - Will there be any existing product data to migrate or integrate with?
   - Is there a current ERP or inventory management system that needs integration?

2. **User Authentication Requirements**
   - Does the system need user registration/login functionality beyond admin access?
   - Are there specific B2B features like account-based pricing or special access levels?

3. **Online Consultation Implementation**
   - Should the online consultation be implemented as a custom solution or integrate with third-party services like LiveChat?
   - Are there specific requirements for routing inquiries to different departments?

4. **Internationalization Plans**
   - When might multi-language support be needed? Should the architecture plan for this from the beginning?

5. **Performance Expectations**
   - What are the expected traffic volumes and peak loads?
   - Are there specific performance metrics that need to be met?
